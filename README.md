# 🐍 Learning Python at the University of Glasgow

This repository contains **lecture notes** (.ipynb) and **slides** (.html) for *Learning Python Programming* at *James Watt School of Engineering, University of Glasgow (UoG)*. 

**Remark** 

Although this repository is available to students taking the course "ENG3092: Mechanical Engineering Skills 3" taught at UoG, it is prepared for a wide group of audiences who want to learn Python at their own space. With this in mind, the repository is pefectly suitable for the course "ENG2083: Introductory Programming 2".

## 📂 Repository Structure
| Directory | Description |
| :---------| :---------- |
| `lecture_notes` | Jupyter Notebook for lecture notes designed for each major topic in learning Python |
| `slides` | Quarto `.qmd` files and generated `.html` files for lecture slides |
| `slides/figures` | Contain subfolders each of which store the figures for one specific topic slide. For example, `slides/figures/python_functions` contain all the figures necessary for running/compiling `python_functions.qmd` |
| `slides/python_xxx` | Folders that are generated by running the corresponding `.qmd` files. For exmaple, by compiling `python_functions.qmd` the folder with name `python_functions_files` is generated. |

## For students: Please read this
This repo is constantly updated throughout the semesters to reflect the questions raised in the lectures. Therefore, it is a good idea to download from time to time this repo and overwrite the old version in your local machine. I recommend you to download every two weeks or every week, especially when you see the new updates shown in the github.

### Download the whole repo
The easiest way is to download this repo from the Github https: [Link to this Repo](https://github.com/khiemnguyen0407/uog-python)

Click on the **Green Tab** `<> Code` when you access the above link, and then choose `Download ZIP`. Unzip the entire downloaded `.zip` file.
## Slides
The slides are prepared using Quarto Technology. In this way, the students and the readers can play around with the code in the presented slides.

## Advanced Learning
This folder contains multiple extra, but not so advanced topics in Python programming. The folder name can be a bit misleading but I don't know a better name for now.
