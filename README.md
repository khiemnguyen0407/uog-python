# Learning Python at the University of Glasgow

## Lecture Notes
The lecture notes are written in format of Jupyter Notebook and are constantly updated throughout the years. Each Jupyter Notebook is a complete, self-contained note for one topic in Python Programming.

## Slides
The slides are prepared using Quarto Technology. In this way, the students and the readers can play around with the code in the presented slides.

## Advanced Learning
This folder contains multiple extra, but not so advanced topics in Python programming. The folder name can be a bit misleading but I don't know a better name for now.
