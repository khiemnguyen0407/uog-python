    "# Object-oriented programming\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**OOP** (Object-oriented programming) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which can contain data and code: data in the form of *fields* (often known as *attributes* or *properties*), and code, in the form of functions or procedures, often known as *methods*.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common feature of objects is that methods are attached to them and can access and modify the object's data fields. In this brand of *OOP*, there is usually a special name such as **this** or **self** used to refer to the current object. In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another. OOP languages are diverse, but the most popular ones are **class-based**, meaning that objects are *instances* of *classes*, which also determine their *types*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the most widely used programming languages (such as **C++**, **Java**, **Python**, etc.) are multi-paradigm and they support object-oriented programming to a greater or lesser degree, typically in combination with imperative, procedural programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the features listed below are common among languages considered to be strongly class- and object-oriented (or multi-paradigm with OOP support).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Objects and classes\n",
    "2. Data abstraction\n",
    "3. Encapsulation\n",
    "4. Composition, inheritance, and delegation\n",
    "5. Polymorphism\n",
    "6. Open recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "We shall discuss these features in the next Markdown but we also revisit them later with concrete examples and Python implementation of these examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, a language supporting *object-oriented programing* should be able to allow imperative programing and modular programing. This feature is shared with non-OOP languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, the OOP language supports built-in data types like integers, alphanumerical characters, float, double and etc. This may also include data structures like strings, lists, and hash tables that are either built-in or result from combining varibles using memory pointers. The language has structured programming constructs like loops and conditionals.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Modular programming* support provides the ability to group procedures into files and modules for organizational purposes. Modules are **namespaced** so identifiers in one module will not conflict with a procedure or variable sharing the same name in another file or module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apparently, Python is a language supporting both imperative programming and modular programming. However, we will discuss now features that are important to OOP."

    "## 1. Objects and classes\n",
    "***\n",
    "Languages that support object-oriented programming (OOP) allows code reuse and extensibility from the concept of inheritance (discussed later). Those that use classes support two main concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Classes -- The definitions for the data format and available methods for a given type or class of object. Classes may also contain data and methods themselves.\n",
    "2. Objects -- instances of classes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objects** sometimes correspond to things found in the real world. For example, a graphics program may have objects such as \"circle\", \"square\", \"menu\". An online shopping system might have objects such as \"shopping cart\", \"customer\", and \"product\". Sometimes objects represent more abstract entities, like an object that represents an open file, or an object that provides the service of translating measurements from U.S. customary to metric. In fact, we already use many objects in Python such as one particular list, one particular tuble or indeed even one integer or one complex number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each object is said to be an instance of a particular class (for example, an object with its name field set to \"Mary\" might be an instance of class Employee). Procedures in object-oriented programming are known as methods; variables are also known as fields, members, attributes, or properties. This leads to the following terms:\n",
    "1. ***Class variables*** -- belong to the class as a *whole*; there is only one copy of each one\n",
    "2. ***Instance variables*** or ***attributes*** -- data that belongs to individual objects; every object has its own copy of each one\n",
    "3. ***Member variables*** -- refers to both the class and instance variables that are defined by a particular class\n",
    "4. ***Class methods*** -- belong to the class as a whole and have access to only class variables and inputs from the procedure call, i.e. the inputs from the outside world (not within the class)\n",
    "5. ***Instance methods*** -- belong to *individual* objects, and have *access to instance variables* for the specific object they are called on, inputs, and class variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects are accessed somewhat like variables with complex internal structure. They provide a layer of abstraction which can be used to separate internal from external code. External code can use an object by calling a specific instance method with a certain set of input parameters, read an instance variable, or write to an instance variable. Objects are created by calling a special type of method in the class known as a ***constructor***. A program may create many instances of the same class as it runs, which operate independently. This is an easy way for the same procedures to be used on different sets of data."

    "### Class definition syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest for of class definition looks like this\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "class ClassName:\n",
    "    <statement-1>\n",
    "    .\n",
    "    .\n",
    "    .\n",
    "    <statement-N>\n",
    "```\n",
    "Class definitions, like function definitions (using `def` statements) must be executed before they have any effect. You could conceivably place a class definition in a branch of an `if` statement, or inside a function though this is not frequently done.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the statements inside a class definition will usually be function definitions, but other statements are allowed and sometimes useful (for example class variables). The function definitions inside a class normally have a peculiar form of argument list, dictated by the calling conventions for methods -- again, this is explained later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class objects\n",
    "\n",
    "**Class objects** support two kinds of operation: *attribute references* and *instatiation*.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Attribute references*** \n",
    "***\n",
    "***Attribute references*** use the standard syntax used for all attribute references in Python: `obj.name`. Valid attribute names are all the names that were in the class's namespace when the class object was created. So if the class definition looked like this\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "class MyClasss:\n",
    "    \"\"\"A simple example class\"\"\"\n",
    "    i = 12345\n",
    "\n",
    "    def say_hello(self):\n",
    "        return \"Hello World\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "then `Myclass.i` and `MyClass.say_hello` are valid attribute references, returning an integer and a function object (not execute the function), respectively. To execute the function `say_hello` defined in `MyClass`, we write `MyClass.say_hello()` (with parentheses). The expression `MyClass.say_hello` just gives a function object, pretty much like a name of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Class instantiation*** \n",
    "***\n",
    "***Class instantiation*** uses function notation. Just pretend that the class object is a *parameterless* function that returns a new instance of the class (i.e. object). For example, the statement \n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "x = MyClass()\n",
    "```\n",
    "creates a new *instance* of the class and assign this object to the local variable x.\n",
    "\n",
    "The instatiation operation (\"calling\" a class object) creates an empty object. Many classes like to creat objects with instances customized to a specific *initial* time. Therefore, a class may define a special method/function named `__init()__` like the following\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "def __init__(self):\n",
    "    self.data = []\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When a class defines an `__init__()` method, class instantiation automatically invokes `__init()__()` for the newly created class instance. So in this example, a new, initialized instance can be obtained by `x = MyClass()` and then we can refer to `x.data`. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Instantiation with multiple input arguments*** \n",
    "***\n",
    "Of course, the `__init()__` method may have many arguments for greater flexibility. In that case, arguments given to the class instantiation operator are passed to the function `__init()__`. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we define a class describing complex numbers. A complex number is given the form $x = a + \\rm{i}\\,b$ where $a$ and $b$ are two real numbers and $\\rm{i}$ is a imaginary unit that is defined as $\\rm{i} = \\sqrt{-1}$. In fact, without using the special character $\\rm{i}$, we may also write $x = a + \\sqrt{-1} b$. Thus, to describe a complex number, it is enough to have the *real part* $a$ and the *imaginary part* $b$ as $\\sqrt{-1}$ is fixed and known in advanced. The code look like this\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "class Complex:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, real_part, imag_part):\n",
    "        self.r = real_part\n",
    "        self.i = imag_part\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then, we can create a complex number and then see its value according to\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "x = Complex(3.0, -4.5)\n",
    "x.r, x.i\n",

    "### Interpretation of self variable\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, all the functions defined in the class Car have a first argument named `self`. It is the right time now to discuss the meaning of the variable `self` in all of the function methods defined in a class. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "class MyDumbDataType():\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, data):\n",
    "        self.data = data\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def write_data_out(self):\n",
    "        print(self.data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now that we have just defined a new data type with the name `MyDumbDataType`. Let say we create an object now and store it to the variable `x` according to\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "x = MyDumbDataType(\"Hello world\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now that the variable `x` has the attribute `data` and the object method `write_data_out()`; to use them we write `x.data` and `x.write_data_out()`. However, during the process of defining the class `MyDumbDataType`, we are not able to create the object and assign it to the variable `x`. Clearly, we cannot write something like `x.data` and `x.write_data_out()` in side the class definition because `x` is not defined therein. Besides, there might be many objects assigned to many variable names such as object-1 to `x`, object-2 to `y` and so on. The only way to refer one such object ***in the seeable-fugure*** is to allow a mechanism in which the class can see an object *in the far but expectable future*. The first variable in all of the function definition with the syntax `def object_method_name(self,...)` permits such mechanism. \n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, the variable `self` used in the function definitions which are in turn place in the class definition refers to the particular object we are dealing with. For example, in the expression `x.__init__(data)` and `x.write_data_out()`, the variable `self` is refering to the object stored at the variable `x`. If there is another object stored at the variable `y`, that is, `y = MyDumbDataType(\"Hello Earth\")`, then in the `y.__init__(data)` and `y.write_data_out()`, the variable `self` is refering to the object stored at `y`.\n",

Some languages (Java, for example) let classes enforce access restrictions explicitly, for example denoting internal data with the private keyword and designating methods intended for use by code outside the class with the public keyword. Methods may also be designed public, private, or intermediate levels such as protected (which allows access from the same class and its subclasses, but not objects of a different class). \n",

    "\n",
    "Encapsulation prevents external code from being concerned with the internal workings of an object. This facilitates code refactoring, for example allowing the author of the class to change how objects of that class represent their data internally without changing any external code (as long as \"public\" method calls work the same way). It also encourages programmers to put all the code that is concerned with a certain set of data in the same class, which organizes it for easy comprehension by other programmers. Encapsulation is a technique that encourages decoupling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Making the data members private looks like a complicated concept and unnecessary. However, it turns out that this is frequently needed in real-world problems. There are many scenarios in which the data members should lie within a given range or only accept particular data types. For example, if a car has a tank capacity of 60 liters, filling the tank with already existed 20 liters by the volume of 50 liters leads to overload. Also, by accidence the external code may fill the tank with string or characters instead of a number. This should leads to an invalid operation and raising errors or notifying the users of wrong inputs. In the worst case, there is no syntax error or obvious error in modifying a data member until this invalid data value spreads through the program and spoils the final results or outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The possibility of hiding the data members and permitting the external users to access or modify it through an interface of member functions or methods makes the code become more complicated, longer.

For example, an object in the Employee class might contain an object in the Address class, in addition to its own instance variables like 'first_name' and 'position'.

For example, class Employee might inherit from class Person. All the data and methods available to the parent class also appear in the child class with the same names. For example, class Person might define variables 'first_name' and 'last_name' with method 'make_full_name()'. These will also be available in class Employee, which might add the variables \"position\" and \"salary\". This technique allows easy re-use of the same procedures and data definitions, in addition to potentially mirroring real-world relationships in an intuitive way. Rather than utilizing database tables and programming subroutines, the developer utilizes objects the user may be more familiar with: objects from their application domain.\n",

    "## 6. Multiple inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important concept related to **inheritance** is **multiple inheritance**. **Multiple inheritance** basically means that one derived/child class can have multiple super/parent classes. Python supports a form of multiple inheritance as well. Thus, we can imagine that not all programming languages support multiple inheritance. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Note* &nbsp; Perhaps these days all of the programming languages support multiple inheritance but I am not sure\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax**\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "class DerivedClassName(Base1, Base2, Base3):\n",
    "    <statement-1>\n",
    "    .\n",
    "    .\n",
    "    .\n",
    "    <statement-N>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Working of search path**\n",
    "\n",
    "If the class `A` is derived from one base class `B`, we can easily deduce the search path of the inheritance relationship. For example, let us assume that the class `B` defines a method `do_something()`. If the class `A` overrides this method by having its own version with the same method name `do_something()`, of course the object of class `A` -- called here `obj_A` would use the overriding method. However, if the class `A` does not have re-definition of `do_something()` on its own, the object `obj_A` will need to search upwards into the class `B` and find that method to execute if called. That is, `obj_A.do_something()` execute the method defined in the class `B`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you can immediately imagine this search path mechanism becomes a bit more complicated in the multiple inheritance. Let us assume that the class `DerivedClassName` is derived from three classes `Base1`, `Base2` and `Base3` according to the above syntax declaration. A natural question would be from which base class among all the base classes `Base1`, `Base2` and `Base3`, the derived class `DerivedClassName` should look for some method that has not been defined in itself. The mechanism works as follows. Note that the above discussion applies not only to the methods but also attributes defined for classes. Thus, we can explain the mechanism equivalently using the word attributes or methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "For most purpose, in the simplest cases, you can think of the search for attributes inherited from a parent class as **depth-first**, **left-to-right**, *not searching twice in the same class where there is an overlap in the hierarchy. Thus, if an attribute is not found in `DerivedClassName`, it is searched for in `Base1`, then (recursively) in the base classed of `Base1`, and if it was not found there, it was searched for in `Base2`, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, it is slightly more complex than that; the method resolution order changes dynamically to support cooperative calls to `super()`. Dynamic ordering is necessary because all cases of multiple inheritance exhibit one or more diamond relationships (where at least one of the parent classes can be accessed through multiple paths from the bottommost class). For example, all classes in Python inherit from `object`, so any case of multiple inheritance provides more than one path to reach `object`. We won't delve into this topic any further. Interested students should find good textbooks in Python and Object-oriented programming to understand dynamic ordering.\n",
