Although, the `for` loop and and the `range()` function are frequently combined to generate looping with a specific number of iterations, `range()` function alone does not return a list, but rather an *iterator* which is an important data type in many programming language. We don't go into depth of this matter for now."

    "### Access elements of list\n",
    "\n",
    "To acceess an item or an element in the list, we must know the numerical index position of that element in the list. For example, let assume `my_list` is a list of $10$ elements. Then, `my_list[0]` returns the first element of `my_list`, `my_list[1]` returns the second element and so on up to `my_list[9]` giving the last element. It is important to remember that the first counter starts from *zero*, which is different MATLAB syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Negative index**: We can also use negative index to access the elements of the list. `my_list[-1]` gives the last element of `my_list`, `my_list[-2]` returns the second last element and so on. Thus, under assumption that `my_list` has $10$ elements, `my_list[9]` and `my_list[-1]` returns the same last element of the list. Similarly, `my_list[8]` and `my_list[-2]` returns the second last element. Notice that \n",
    "$$9 - (-1) = 10,\\quad 8 - (-2) = 10.$$\n",
    "For this reason, we can extrapolate that if the considered list `my_list` has $N$ elements, and $0 \\leq m < N$, we have `my_list[m]` and `my_list[N-m]` access to the same element in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Slicing**: We can access multiple elements of the list by using the *slicing*. While indexing is used to obtain individual element, *slicing* allows us to obtaining a sublist of the original list. The slicing syntax can be summarized as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "my_list[<start_index> : <end_index>]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "with the last index `end_index` is excluded so that the returned list does not contain element `my_list[end_index]`. For example, `my_list[0:2]` returns elements with indices 0 and 1 (excluding 2). It is important to note the last number in a slicing is excluded. Thus, `my_list[0:2]` returns 2 elements (not 3 elements as we might think). In this manner, `my_list[n:m]` with $n < m$ returns $m - n$ elements."

Unlike sequences (e.g., *list* and *tuple*), which are indexed by a range of numbers (indexing and slicing), **dictionaries** are indexed by **keys**, which can be any *immutable type*; strings and numbers can always be keys. Tuples can be used as keys if they contain only strings, numbers, or tuples; if a tuple contains any mutable object either directly or indirectly, it cannot be used as key. You cannot use lists as keys, since lists can be modified in place using index assigments, slice assignments or methods like `append()` and `extend()`. The keys must be uniqe.\n",

    "#### <font color=\"red\">**Exercise 1**</font>: List vs numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "List is a built-in data structure in Python and can hold as many objects/variables of different data types as possible. However, when it comes to calculation with numbers, list is not a powerful data type because operations on list is very expensive. On the hand, `numpy` is another library that is designed for holding floating numbers and performing complex algebraic computations such as dot product of two vectors, tensor products between high-order tensors, multiplication between a matrix and a vector, and son. In this exercise, we learn how to use `numpy` for matrix multiplication with one simple function. In contrast, by using list we must write two `for` loops to perform such multiplication of two matrices.\n",

    "Let $\\mathbf{A}$ of size [$m_1 \\times m_2$] and $\\mathbf{B}$ of size [$m_2 \\times m_3$] be two matrices. Let $\\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}$ be the multiplication between $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ which is defined as\n",

    "\n",
    "To compute matrix $\\mathbf{C}$ using `numpy`, the task is very simple. See the following Python code right after this exercise.\n",
