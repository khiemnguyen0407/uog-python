    "else print(False)\n",

    "\n",
    "In fact, the syntax errors can be easily spotted in most of modern IDE these days. For example, in VSCode the IDE parser can pick up most of the trivial syntax errors before we execute the code. After execution, the interpreter issues `SyntaxError' and tell you where it expects the error occur. If the code becomes quite complex, the interpreter may give you a wrong hint about where the errors occur.\n",

If you come from different programming languages, you may find a lot of these errors are actually runtime errors. Below are some examples:\n",
    "- $10/0$ would give the error `ZeroDivisionError` as it violates the simple mathematics rule. \n",
    "- The statement `3 * spam` is executed while the variable `spam` is not defined before this statement. This gives `NameError`.\n",
