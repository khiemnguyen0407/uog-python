    "## First few words about **NumPy**\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "**NumPy** (Numerical Python) is open source Python library that's used in almost every field of science and engineering. It's the universal standard for working with numerical data in Python, and it's at the core of the scientific Python and PyData ecosystems. By PyData, it refers to a branch of application of Python in Data Science. NumPy users include everyone from beginning coders to experienced researchers doing state-of-the-art scientific and industrial research and development. The NumPy API is used extensively in Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, scikit-image and most other data science and scientific Python packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **NumPy** library contains multi-dimensional array and matrix data structures (you'll find more information about this later). It provides `ndarray`, a homogeneous n-dimensional array object, with methods to efficiently operate on it. NumPy can be used to perform a wide variety of mathematical operations on arrays. It adds powerful data structures to Python that guarantee efficient calculations with arrays and matrices and it supplies an enormous library of high-level mathematical functions that operate on these arrays and matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "**Installing NumPy**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you run the command line `import numpy as np` with error, it is very likely that you have not installed NumPy package. You can install NumPy using the Anaconda CMD prompt or Anaconda with the command\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "conda install numpy\n",
    "```\n",
    "or directly using the Jupyter Notebook with the command\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "pip install numpy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "**How to import Numpy**\n",
    "You have already used it for some time. But it is good to repeat\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "```\n",
    "We shorten the imported name to `np` for better readability of code using NumPy. This is widely adopted convention that you should follow so that anyone working with your code can easily understand it.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "**What's the difference between a Python list and a NumPy array**?\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy gives you an enormous range of fast and efficient ways of creating arrays and manipulating numerical data inside them. While a Python list can contain different data types within a single list, all of the elements in a NumPy array should be homogeneous. The mathematical operations that are meant to be performed on arrays would be extremely inefficient if the arrays werenâ€™t homogeneous.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why use NumPy?** &nbsp; NumPy arrays are faster and more compact than Python lists. An array consumes less memory and is convenient to use. NumPy uses much less memory to store data and it provides a mechanism of specifying the data types. This allows the code to be optimized even further."

    "An array is a central data structure of the NumPy library. An array is a grid of values and it contains information about the raw data, how to locate an element, and how to interpret an element. It has a grid of elements that can be indexed in various ways. The elements are all of the same type, referred to as the array `dtype`.\n",
    "\n",
    "An array can be indexed by a tuple of non-negative integers, by booleans, by another array, or by integers. The rank of the array is the number of dimensions. The shape of the array is a tuple of integers giving the size of the array along each dimension.\n",

    "\n",

    "We can create an array filled with zeros by `np.zeros()`, or an array filled with 1's by `np.ones()`, or even an empty array with `np.empty()`. The function `np.empty()` creates an array whose initial content is random and depends on the state of the memory. The reason to use `np.empty()` over `np.zeros()` (or something similar) is speed - just make sure to fill every element afterwards. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can create an array with a range of elements using `np.arange()`, just like `range()` function of Python. However, `np.arange()` allows non-integer step size. WE can also use `np.linspace()` to create an array with values that spaced linearly in a specified interval.\n",

    "### Deeper Understanding: **`repr()` versus `str()`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, NumPy array is a data type of class `ndarray` and thus it has the so-called builtin function name `__repr()__` that is defined to show the representation of the object. On the other hand, the builtin function name `__str()__ ` is used to show readable output. When we don't pass the `ndarray` to the function `print()` and just type out the variable name, this is equivalent to pass the variable to the function `repr()`. In this case, the representation of an `ndarray` will be shown on the output console. On the other hand, by by passing the `ndarray` to function `print()`, the output is for end user to read it. In this case, the statement `print(x)` is equivalent to `str(x)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "`str()` is used for creating output for end user while `repr()` is mainly used for debugging and development, `repr()`'s goal is to be *ungmbiguous* and `str()`'s is to be readable. For example, if we suspect a float has a small rounding error, `repr()` will show us while `str()` may not."

Then, we can stack or combine $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ horizontally to have a new matrix of shape $(4 \\times 2)$ or vertically to have obtain the matrix of shape $(2 \\times 4)$.

    "As seen above, we can create one-dimensinoal arrays and multi-dimensional arrays. Very often, we want to work with the same set of numbers or elements but it is more convenient to visualize the set in different shapes. For example, a 3D vector in mathematics consists of three numbers but we can visualize it as a column vector or a row vector. The column vector and the row vector are example of two-dimensional arrays of different shapes; $(n \\times 1)$ for the column vector of $n$ elements and $(1 \\times n)$ for the row vector $n$ elements. Clearly, the $n$-dimensional vector in the mathematical sense has $n$ elements regardless how we want to visualize it. Thus, it is important to know the number of dimensions of an array, how to transform an array into different arrays of different sizes but with the same number elements. The object of type `ndarray` is equipped with many attributes and methods to query the number of dimensions, reshaping the array. This will be the topic of this section."

    "If you wan to learn more about C and Fortran order [read more about the internal organization of NumPy arrays here](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/dev/internals.html#numpy-internals). Essentially, C and Fortran orders have to do with how indices correspond to the order the array is stored in memory. In Fortran, when moving through the elements of a two-dimensional array as it is stored in memory, the first index is the most rapidly varying index. As the first index moves to the next row as it changes, the matrix is stored one column at a time. This is why Fortran is thought of as a **Column-major** language. In C on the other hand, the last index changes the most rapidly. The matrix is stored by rows, making it a **Row-major** language. What you do for C or Fortran depends on whether itâ€™s more important to preserve the indexing convention or not reorder the data."

What happens is that the condition will be evaluated in the element-wise fashion, i.e., for each element of the array. Then, we receive the new array in which the values `True` correspond to the elements that fulfill the condition, or the values `False` otherwise. This new array holding only Boolean values will act like a masking array telling the original array which element should be picked up. Only elements corresponding to the `True` of the masking array are chosen.\n",

Following this explanation, we can conclude, for example `a[[True, False, False, False, True]]` would return `np.array([1, 3, 5])`."

One of the most basic things to remember when dealing with NumPy array is that most of the mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and so on are working on the element-by-element basis. Assume that $\\otimes$ is an operation acting on two NumPy array `a` and `b` of shape $(n_0, n_1, \\ldots, n_M)$, denoted mathematically hereby as $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$. The operation symbol $\\otimes$ is just a symbol that may represent the addition $+$, the subtraction $-$, the multiplication $\\ast$ and the division $/$.\n",

    "**Example**\n",
    "Assume that `a` and `b` are two arrays of shape `(3, 4)`, the expression `c = a + b` will be evaluated by adding each element in `a` to the corresponding element in `b` with the same index position. For example, if `a` and `b` are two matrices, then `a[0][0]` will be added to `b[0][0]` and assigned to `c[0][0]`, `a[0][1]` added to `b[0][1]` and assigned to `c[0][1]` and so on. Thus, we have the following pattern\n",

    "We can see that the multiplication returns a vector of shape `(4,)` instead of a column vector of size [4 x 1], or shape `(4, 1)` as we expect in matrix calculation. However, this is perfectly right in the concept of linear algebra. As already explained above, a vector in a mathematical sense contains 4 elements for 4 dimensions and it can be represented as a column vector of shape `(4, 1)` or a row vector of shape `(1, 4)`. If `b` is a column vector, the statement `A.dot(b)` will work out perfectly fine because `A.dot(b)` basically means the normal multiplication between matrices. However, if `b` is represented as a row vector, the statement `A.dot(b)` will raise an error because we cannot multiply a matrix of size [4 x 3] by matrix of size [1 x 4]. In this case, we can still multiply the matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ by the transpose of the row vector $\\mathbf{b}$ so that the right code would be `A.dot(b.transpose())` or `A.dot(b.T)`."
